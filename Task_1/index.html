  Here we can see that when a loop is nested, the outer loop will not increment until the inner loop satisfies its criteria. 
  The process is this: first the outer loop will execute, then the inner loop with keep going until the condition is met.
  We move back into the outer loop where it will increment and execute, before moving onto the inner loop.
  This repeats until the outer loop has met its criteria. 
  In this way, we can use loops within loops in creative ways. */}
